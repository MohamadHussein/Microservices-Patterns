# Microservices-Patterns

Note: this code was written a while ago but I decided to publish it by the time of this repo creation.

This project was created to document my learning journey where I learn new concepts and apply them on simple use-cases to solidify my understanding.

Hopefully others will find this project helpful. 

This repo is about microservices patterns, where I create spring-boot based applications to demonstrate some of the most common microservices patterns.

## Covered Concepts and Cases 
* Service Registry
* Api Gateways and Circuit Breakers
* Config Servers
* HATEOS and Exception Handling
* Message Brokers
* JPA (SQL and NoSQL)
* Event Sourcing (CQRS)
* Logging

## Getting Started
Each directory contains several applications, you should have all apps in the same directory working at the same time in order to get the expected behavior 


### Prerequisites



- [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html)

### Running the application


Each module contains its own driver method which can be used to try out those modules.
